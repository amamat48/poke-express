If my app does not work properly i am sorry for that, I kept getting this error node:internal/errors:490
    node:internal/errors:490
        ErrorCaptureStackTrace(err);
    ^

Error: querySrv ETIMEOUT _mongodb._tcp.cluster0.74bnobs.mongodb.net
    at QueryReqWrap.onresolve [as oncomplete] (node:internal/dns/promises:251:17) {
  errno: undefined,
  code: 'ETIMEOUT',
  syscall: 'querySrv',
  hostname: '_mongodb._tcp.cluster0.74bnobs.mongodb.net'
}

, and I couldn't figure out why it was happening so if when you grade this, you can help me solve it and connect it to the database
that would be great
